            <h3><b>About the workshop</b></h3>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the increasing integration of digital technologies and innovative mobility solutions, network designs aim to enhance the efficiency and safety of transportation networks. Intelligent traffic management systems can collect and process real-time data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and connected vehicles to optimize traffic flow, alleviate congestion, and elevate the overall efficiency of transportation systems. Network designs are engineered with intelligent algorithms that factor in real-time traffic conditions, road incidents, and various other dynamic elements. Dynamic routing and navigation ensures the provision of optimal routes for both drivers and connected vehicles, contributing to a more streamlined and responsive transportation experience. The increasing prevalence of digital connectivity in transportation can also bring forth security challenges. To address emerging security issues, network designs must include robust measures essential to protect sensitive information exchanged within the transportation network.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This workshop aims to create a casual academic environment for researchers, professionals, students, and enthusiasts to interact and exchange ideas. Through engaging talks by invited speakers and interactive discussions, participants will delve into network design challenges, innovative solutions, and gain insights to better understand the complexities and opportunities in the digital mobility era.</p>

                <p><b>Topic: Alleviating Bus Bunching via Modular Vehicle</b></p>
                <p><u>Abstract</u>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Modular vehicles are a novel concept that allows for the coupling and decoupling of
                    different vehicle modules and enables in-motion passenger transfers; it can
                    potentially increase the flexibility of the transportation system. Recent studies have
                    numerically highlighted the potential of using modular vehicles as transit buses to
                    mitigate the bus bunching phenomenon. Building upon this, this study first offers a
                    comprehensive and systematic analytical assessment of the bunching-proof
                    capabilities associated with modular buses, and then proposes novel bus bunching
                    alleviation strategies.

                <p><b>Topic: A Data-Driven Analysis of Urban Traffic Networks</b></p>
                <p><u>Abstract</u>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this presentation, we will discuss how to bring together concepts from statistical physics and
                    transportation engineering into a single science of traffic networks, with the goal of improving the
                    performance of urban traffic, ultimately making our cities more sustainable. We will show that traffic
                    and the ensuing congestion patterns for any given city are reproducible across days. Hence, it is enough
                    to monitor the traffic performance of only a few roads to classify daily patterns and the resulting
                    congestion patterns, allowing cities to reduce monitoring costs. In fact, road and bus network topology
                    can explain around 90% of the empirically observed variation in network capacity for over 40 cities
                    around the world. Moreover, it is possible to relate the road level dynamics to the network level
                    dynamics by observing the number and size of traffic congestion pockets. This allows us to use concepts
                    from physics (such as percolation) to describe the propagation of congestion, so that we can model it
                    using sparse network-level data. It also gives us insights into the ability of different networks to cope
                    with congestion, and the moment at which such congestion becomes so widespread that the whole
                    network collapses.

                <p><b>Topic: Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization and its Implications to Dynamic Routing </b></p>
                <p><u>Abstract</u>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last decade has witnessed the impressive development of machine learning (ML) techniques - successfully applied to traditional 
                    statistical learning tasks as image recognition and leading to breakthroughs like the famous AlphaGo system. Motivated by those 
                    successes, many scientific disciplines have started to investigate the potential for the use of a large amount of data crunched by 
                    ML techniques in their context. Combinatorial optimization (CO) has been no exception to this trend, and the ML use in CO has been 
                    analyzed from many different angles with various levels of success. In this talk, we briefly review the state of the art of this 
                    scientific path and then we discuss the use of learning for dynamic re-optimization of routing in the context of deliveries in 
                    urban areas. This is an especially promising area with direct implications on optimizing multimodal transportation.
